# Hybrid-recommendation-system

# Description:
A Hybrid Recommendation System combines multiple recommendation approaches to leverage the strengths of each. By merging techniques like:

* Collaborative filtering (user-item interactions)

* Content-based filtering (item features)

* This system can handle:

* Cold-start problems (when user/item data is sparse)

* Improved accuracy by combining different data sources

In this project, we’ll build a hybrid system that blends collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates user-item ratings and item descriptions

* Applies collaborative filtering (user-based) and content-based filtering (item descriptions)

* Combines both approaches with weighted averaging to generate hybrid recommendations

* Recommends items to User1 based on both their ratings and item features
